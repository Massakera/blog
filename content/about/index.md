I’m Enzo Massaki, a self-proclaimed code masochist. Welcome to "Massaki’s Dump"—a messy pile of drafts, rants, and half-baked thoughts on software engineering, data pipelines, AI engineering, and random shit like taming a 2-month-old puppy that’s shredding my phone charger. 

I’ve got 4+ years screwing around with code, from Python Redis clones to an LLVM interpreter. I survived calculus, complex number theory research, and enough math at UFSM to make me question everything. Oh, and I did some blood donation volunteering because, well, why not.
